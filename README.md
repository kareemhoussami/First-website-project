Introduction
I am a proud student at Arab Open University. For my MidTerm 2 project in the course TT284, I developed a frontend e-commerce platform where I showcase and sell products such as mobile phones, laptops, hardware, and software. This project allowed me to apply the web application development steps learned in the course and gain practical experience in creating a functional and user-friendly website.
Body
To create my website, I used HTML and CSS. The first step was gathering and editing pictures to make them suitable for the website. I then created the homepage and styled it using CSS to ensure a professional appearance. The homepage includes a section where users can view our popular products. Next, I developed a shop page where users can browse all products, complete with prices and names. Additionally, I created an about page to provide more information about myself and the website, as well as a contact page for users to reach out to me.
After completing the initial development, I tested the website and made minor tweaks to the design to enhance its professional look. My main competitors are Ayoub Computers, which focuses on both in-store and online selling, and Shopify, which offers a wide range of products online. By analyzing these competitors, I identified several areas where my website could be improved.
Comparison with Competitors
Ayoub Computers primarily focuses on in-store selling but also has an online presence. Their website is user-friendly and offers a seamless shopping experience. Shopify, on the other hand, is a well-established e-commerce platform that provides a wide variety of products and features. Compared to these competitors, my website offers a more personalized shopping experience with a focus on specific product categories. However, there are areas where my website can be enhanced to match the functionality and efficiency of these competitors.
Enhancements for Future Work
To enhance the functionality and efficiency of my website, I plan to implement the following three main points:
1.	Improved Search Functionality: Adding an advanced search feature will help users find products more easily and quickly, improving the overall user experience.
2.	User Reviews and Ratings: Incorporating a review and rating system will allow users to share their feedback and help others make informed purchasing decisions.
3.	Mobile Optimization: Ensuring that the website is fully optimized for mobile devices will enhance accessibility and provide a better user experience for mobile users.

Conclusion
Developing a web application is a multi-step process that requires careful planning, development, and evaluation. By analyzing competitors and identifying areas for improvement, the project is well-positioned for future enhancements that will increase its efficiency and user satisfaction. Implementing advanced search functionality, user reviews and ratings, and mobile optimization will significantly enhance the website's functionality and efficiency, making it more competitive in the market.
